STSF uses a similar algorithm as TSF to build decision trees. 
However the difference lies in the feature space used, the time series representation 
and the sampling strategy. The goal is to reduce the interval space size 
to $O(\log M)$ and to find more discriminate intervals to achieve better classification.
Instead of relying on random intervals, it employs
a supervised search to identify informative intervals 
across multiple representations.

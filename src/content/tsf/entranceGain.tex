Entropy gain however has its limits, because "the number of  %TODO: ref Entropy gain
candidate splits can be large, and there are often cases 
where multiple candidate splits have the same $\Delta\operatorname{Entropy}$. %TODO: ref main paper


The paper introduced the splitting criterion entrance gain. % TODO: ref
For this the difference between the the threshold $\tau$ and the value
of the interval feature of all timeseries in the dataset is considered. The minimum
of all those values is called the $\operatorname{Margin}$.

For a split $f_k^n(t_{\mathrm{start}}, t_{\mathrm{end}}) \leq \tau$ for the timeseries $n$ 
\[
	\operatorname{Margin} = \min_{n = 1,2, ..., N} \left|f_k^n (t_{\mathrm{start}}, t_{\mathrm{end}}) - \tau \right|
\]

Entrance gain $E$ then is the combination of this Margin and $\Delta$Entropy with a a scalar $\alpha$ small 
enough to make the entrance gain a tiebreaker and nothing more.

\[
	E = \Delta\operatorname{Entropy} + \alpha \cdot\operatorname{Margin}
\]

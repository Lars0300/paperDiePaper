At each node running the for loops has a complexity 
of $M$ intervals, 3 interval features and $\kappa$ thresholds.
Each depth of the tree has at most $|data| = N$ nodes and the maximum depth of a tree can be assumed
as $O(\log N)$. As $\kappa$ is a constant the time complexity
for a single tree can be seen as $O(M N \log N)$. For a forest 
with $nTree$ trees that means the time complexity is at most $O(nTree M N \log N)$

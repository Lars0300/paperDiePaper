Time series classification (TSC) presents significant challenges in domains requiring both 
high efficiency and interpretability, particularly for long and high-frequency sensor data. 
Existing state-of-the-art models achieve strong performance but often suffer from prohibitive
computational costs and opaque decision processes. This paper introduces the Supervised Time 
Series Forest (STSF), a novel interval-based TSC method that directly addresses these limitations. 
STSF employs a supervised binary search strategy across three complementary time series 
representations—original, derivative, and frequency domain—guided by feature ranking metrics 
such as the Fisher score. Unlike the Time Series Forest (TSF), which relies on random interval 
sampling, STSF drastically reduces the feature space from quadratic to logarithmic scale, enabling 
orders-of-magnitude faster training times. Experimental results on 85 benchmark datasets 
demonstrate that STSF achieves classification accuracy on par with state-of-the-art methods like 
HIVE-COTE and TS-CHIEF, while maintaining linear complexity in practice. Additionally, STSF enables 
interpretable classification via regions of interest derived from discriminatory interval overlaps.
The proposed method bridges the gap between performance, scalability, and interpretability, 
offering a viable TSC solution for modern data-intensive applications.
